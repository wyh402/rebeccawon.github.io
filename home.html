            <h1>Welcome to Rebecca's Web Dev Journal!</h1>
            <p>Being a typical Internet user, I've visit a <em>significant</em> number of websites everyday.
                I've always wondered how all these websites were built and how they work, but I never really knew where to start learning these things.
                Then, taking Web Dev seminar at CSK 2020 (<a href="https://cs-kickstart.berkeley.edu" target="_blank">click</a> to see more info about CSK), I was exposed to several web development skills, which seem to fulfill my long-time curiosity.
                I was instantly captured. Throughout my years at Berkeley, I hope to gain more knowledge on web development, and while doing so, I plan to keep track of my learning on this website.

            <p>There are two broad sections of web development: front-end development (aka client-side development) and back-end development (aka server-side development)</p>
            <h4>1. Front-End</h4>
            <p>Front-end, which is infact is the working interface, is what cooperates with a user. This is mainly done with three codes--HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTML</strong> provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and motified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript.</li>
                <li><strong>CSS</strong> is used to control presentation, formatting, and layout.</li>
                <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> is used to control the behavior of different elements.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>2. Back-End</h4>
            <p>Back-end development is responsible for developing the server side of a website, or the "invisible engine". Back-end scripts are written in many different coding languages and frameworks, such as...</p>
            <ul>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
                <li>JAVA</li>
